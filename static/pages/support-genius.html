                    <p>SupportGenius is a customer success analytics app designed to turn support tickets into valuable customer insights.</p>
                    <p>This app uses linear regression to predict the relationship between the number of customer-agent interactions and ticket resolution time (Figure 1) and the relationship between the time of day that a ticket is submitted and the time it takes an agent to respond (Figure 2). Both of these graphs, along with the ticket submission time heatmap (Figure 3) can help support managers decide how many agents to put on a certain shift and see whether tickets are being resolved in an efficient manner.</p>

    <p>A fourth graph (Figure 4) shows how different groups of customers are related. It displays the result of the meanshift algorithm processing 800 Markov chain-generated fake tickets from fake customers (further explained on <a href="https://github.com/thejuliaguenther/hackbright-final-project/tree/master/hackbright_project" target="_blank" class="linkStyle">GitHub</a>). This algorithm creates clusters of similar customers to see if similar customers share similar sentiments about the company's product. The sentiments of the tickets were determined by the Mashape Text-Processing API. Analyzing the sentiments of groups of similar customers would be extremely useful to support team managers or customer success managers as it would allow them to adjust their support/relationship management strategies for each group of customers.</p>
